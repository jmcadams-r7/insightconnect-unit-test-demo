# insightconnect-unit-test-demo

This is a demo repo for unit testing [InsightConnect](https://www.rapid7.com/products/insightconnect/) plugins. 

This code shows the result of generating unit tests using `icon-plugin generate unittest` and completing the templates that are created. 

In this repo you will find a working demo plugin that hits the API that's available in the testapp folder. 

The testapp folder is a very simple web application with an API. To run it, with python3, run the api.py and you should have a Flask web application ready on port 5000. 

To run the plugin follow the instructions found [here](https://github.com/rapid7/insightconnect-plugins)
